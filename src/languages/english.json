Some of the important features chosen for this classification task are area of the images, number of images on a page, number of words on a page, and presence of some keywords (such as scale, kilometers or meters, figure, or north, etc.). We then trained several classification models using k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, random forest, and Xgboost on a sample dataset of PDFs and calculated the accuracy of these models. The optimum classification model was selected based on the accuracy and the process time. Since we got an accuracy level of >95% for the optimal model, we then used this model to classify all the PDF pages in the ESA databank to classify alignment sheets."

For example, tables with clear, black borders are easier to extract accurately compared to tables that have unclear or no borders. Our team employed a manual validation process for a sample of the tables, figures, and PDFs. It is possible that there are tables in PDFs that were not extracted or tables that were extracted, but are missing some data. It is estimated that 94% to 98% of all tables in PDF have been extracted, and that 88% to 94% of all tables have complete data (based on a random sample of 384 tables).",

Figure extraction was not perfect because of different titles for the same figure appearing in the table of contents vs. the body of text (due to spelling variability, inconsistency in labeling formats, or no title present). Secondly, figure titles that were embedded as images were undetected with a text-based extraction approach. Finally, in a small percentage of PDF files (0.95%), the extraction process led to corrupt images where the text/image blocks are partially retained and the rest of the figure is replaced by black colour.",
