# Navigation Buttons

The NavButtons component is a component that has buttons to navigate to the 4 different pages in the app. NavButtons will appear different depending on the page the user is currently on. When the user is on landing, there will be 3 big buttons to navigate to the 3 different information pages. When the user is on any of the information pages, the same 3 will appear, but smaller. Finally, when the user is on the search page, there will only be a small back button.
