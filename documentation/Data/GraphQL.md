# GraphQL

We will be making use of GraphQL to easily query data from the server. This will
be implemented in C# in the ASP.Net application running on the CER infrastructure.

- Queries should be kept in `./src/hooks/queries.js`
- Inspect GraphQL endpoint for *Enum*, *Type*, and *Query* schema documentation
